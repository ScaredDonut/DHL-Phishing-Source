# DHL-Phisthing-Source

Soooo some guy decided to email me trying to get my credit card number using this DHL phishing attack. I managed to get the source code by playing around with the URL - I managed to gain access to an unsecured sub-folder with a random RAR file called "DHL.rar" downloaded it, scanned it and it appeared to be clean.

So yeah thought I'd share it for educational purposes.
